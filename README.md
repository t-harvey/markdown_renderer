Introduction
------------
The I2C API supports the I2C protocol, which allows multiple slave chips to
communicate with one or more master chips.  Each I2C bus has two signals - SDA
and SCL. SDA is the data signal and SCL is the clock signal.

Web IDL
-------
This IDL provides an overview of the interface; see below for
documentation of specific API functions.  We have a short document
explaining [ZJS WebIDL conventions](Notes_on_WebIDL.md).

I2C API
-------
### i2c.open(init)
* `init` *I2CInit* Lets you set the I2C bus you wish to use and the speed you
want to operate at. Speed options are 10, 100, 400, 1000, and 34000. Speed is
measured in kbs.
* Returns: an I2CBus object.

I2CBus API
----------
### i2cBus.write(device, data)
* `device` *octet* The device address.
* `data` *Buffer* The data to be written.

Writes the data to the given device address. The first byte of data typically
contains the register you want to write the data to.  This will vary from device
to device.

### i2cBus.read(device, size, registerAddress)
* `device` *octet* The device address.
* `size` *unsigned long* The number of bytes of data to read.
* `registerAddress` *octet* The register on the device from which to read.

Reads 'size' bytes of data from the device at the registerAddress. The default
value of registerAdress is 0x00;

### I2CBus.burstRead(device, size, registerAddress)
* `device` *octet* The device address.
* `size` *long* The number of bytes of data to read.
* `registerAddress` *octet* The number of the starting address from which to read.

Reads 'size' bytes of data from the device across multiple addresses starting
at the registerAddress. The default value of registerAdress is 0x00;
